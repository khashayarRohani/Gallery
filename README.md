# Gallery

##Here I made a gallery using (flex,responsive design, ARIA , accessibility like tabindex in css related to it)

#if you using tab to shift the element i made a css for that so you can easily findout where you are

#you can change the images with left and right button as well(selecting image or using Next and Privious button is also available)

#if you move the mouse over each image you can see a message

#if you check the JS file there are all comments related to what i did in each step

#the thing that i've done for changing picture is that: first I find the current image which is displayed then i take its index and add a unit or take away a unit of that then I check the circumstance of the new index and then i apply it on the next steps

#there are 2 Url one of them is used for github pages and one of them is used for go live extension of the VS code. it is used for finding the current displayed image.

#in my Gallery array there is 3 item: title-for hover info imageSrc for creating html img tag and initialize the src attribute, and a checkingSrc which combines with Url to find the picture.

#the thing that i had problem with was the animation of fading for my displayed images and I have plan for making them right in weeks ahead.
